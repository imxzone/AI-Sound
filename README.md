In recent years, the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has witnessed remarkable advancements, particularly in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and content generation. One of the most notable, yet challenging, outcomes of this progress is the emergence of Deepfake technology. Deepfakes, initially known primarily in the realm of images and videos, have now extended to the audio domain, creating incredibly convincing audio replicas of real people.

The advent of audio deepfakes presents both significant opportunities and risks. On one hand, this technology has the potential to revolutionize fields such as entertainment content production (e.g., creating voices for animated characters, dubbing films), assistive technology for people with disabilities (e.g., restoring voices for individuals who have lost their voice), and cultural heritage preservation (e.g., reconstructing the voices of historical figures). On the other hand, audio deepfakes can also be misused to create misinformation, financial fraud, defamation, and even political interference.

Currently, methods for detecting audio deepfakes are still limited. Traditional techniques often rely on analyzing acoustic features such as pitch, timbre, and rhythm, but these methods are easily fooled by advanced deepfake techniques. Therefore, the development of robust and reliable audio deepfake detection methods is crucial to protect society from the potential negative impacts of this technology.

This project focuses on researching and developing a novel approach for detecting audio deepfakes, based on combining advanced deep learning techniques and complex acoustic feature analysis. Our goal is to create a system capable of detecting audio deepfakes with high accuracy, while also being resilient to adversarial attacks and emerging deepfake variations. The success of this project will make a significant contribution to mitigating the risks associated with audio deepfakes and promoting the responsible use of this technology
